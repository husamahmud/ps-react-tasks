## Task 3: Implement Tabs using React

### Description

Build a tabs component that displays one panel of content at a time depending on
the active tab element.

### Requirements

- Clicking on a tab makes it the active tab. Add a visual indication (e.g. using
  blue text color) for the active tab to differentiate it from the non-active
  tabs.
- At all times, only one panel's contents should be displayed â€” the one
  corresponding to the active tab's.

### Notes

- The focus of this question is on functionality, not the styling. There's no
  need to write any custom CSS except for highlighting the active tab.
- You may modify the markup (e.g. adding ids, data attributes, replacing some
  tags, etc) and use client-side rendering instead.
- You may want to think about ways to improve the user experience of the
  application and implement them (you get bonus credit for doing that during
  interviews).
