You can customize which elements can become draggable, the type of feedback the draggable elements produce, and the droppable elements.

Event types
drag
This event is fired when an element or text selection is being dragged.

dragend
This event is fired when a drag operation is being ended (by releasing a mouse button or hitting the escape key).

dragenter
This event is fired when a dragged element or text selection enters a valid drop target.

dragleave
This event is fired when a dragged element or text selection leaves a valid drop target.

dragover
This event is fired continuously when an element or text selection is being dragged and the mouse pointer is over a valid drop target (every 50 ms WHEN mouse is not moving ELSE much faster between 5 ms (slow movement) and 1ms (fast movement) approximately. This firing pattern is different than mouseover ).

dragstart
This event is fired when the user starts dragging an element or text selection.

drop
This event is fired when an element or text selection is dropped on a valid drop target.
